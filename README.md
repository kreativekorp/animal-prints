# Animal Prints

Animal Prints can open Animal Crossing design patterns in many formats (.acnh, .acnl, and .acww files; ACNL QR codes; and generic image files), convert patterns between these formats, and save patterns in these formats, as well as produce paint-by-letter instructions.

## Send to ACNH

Using a USB-to-serial adapter and a microcontroller with custom firmware to emulate a Switch controller, Animal Prints can automate the creation of design patterns in-game.
